# PROJECT ON DISEASE PREDICTION 

Here in this project i have folllowed 5 basic steps
1.Data Collection
2.Data Analysis
3.Data Processing
4.Algorithm Selection
5.Data Vizualization

--> In Data Collection i have made 132 columns where it contains various symptoms on which the the disease is predicted.

--> Here i have choosed 40 disease
     1.Fungal Infection
